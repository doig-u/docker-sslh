# docker-sslh
Docker image exposing sslh (SSH/HTTPS/OpenVPN multiplexer) 

## Quick Start

* Start the SSLH server process, expose port 443

```
    docker run -d -p 443:443 --name sslh1 doigu/sslh
```

* You can set environment variables to define the service routing (here with their default values).

```
     LISTEN_IP 0.0.0.0
     LISTEN_PORT 443
     SSH_HOST localhost
     SSH_PORT 22
     OPENVPN_HOST localhost
     OPENVPN_PORT 1194
     HTTPS_HOST localhost
     HTTPS_PORT 8443
     ENV SHADOWSOCKS_HOST localhost
     ENV SHADOWSOCKS_PORT 8388
     ENV SOCKS_HOST localhost
     ENV SOCKS_PORT 1080
```

* However if you need to route to other Docker containers, don't forget to link them and then place the instance name in the environment:
 
```
    docker run -d -p 443:443 --link web1 -e HTTPS_HOST=web1 -e HTTPS_PORT=443  amondit/sslh
```

## Notes

Please note that I defaulted the HTTPS forward port to localhost:8443 because the service will by default bing sslh on all interfaces and setting the forward to localhost:443 could cause a loop. It's no big deal anyway as you will probably use this image to reference external services (whether they're linked Docker containers or external IPs), so you'll never have to use localhost. Unless you're using this image as a base for extension to run multiple services on 1 container, which you shouldn't as it would be against the philosophy of Docker.
